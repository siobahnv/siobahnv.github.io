Deployed site: [siobahnv.github.io](https://siobahnv.github.io/) <br>

This is a professional landing page for myself using GitHub Pages. <br>

## Built With
Mostly vanilla HTML and JavaScript with a dash of CSS, due to being a simpler static page. No database. No API calls.  <br>

There's *no Jekyll*. That's right, this does not actually make use of the Jekyll site generator and structure as suggested by Github. <br>

Since there's no Jekyll and there's no templates, the main content and most boilerplate will be in index.html. <br>
